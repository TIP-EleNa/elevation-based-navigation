# elevation-based-navigation

This app is the project from cs520 class at UMass Amherst in Fall, 2019. The goal is to develop a live map web/mobile app that provides users the convenience to find itinerary with the least elevation. It can benefit people especially bikers and disabilities so they can save their effort from climbing. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need `node.js` and `npm` installed on your machine.<br />
Please install them before you proceed. I recommend using `brew` to install them.

```
# open termianl
$ brew update

# install node.js and npm
$ brew install node

# test if the installation succeed and versions
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```

### Installing

Clone and direct to the repo you just cloned or downloaded. 

```
# with ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:TIP-EleNa/elevation-based-navigation.git

# with http
$ git clone https://github.com/TIP-EleNa/elevation-based-navigation.git

$ cd elevation-based-navigation
```

Install all dependencies. See `package.json` for more information. 

```
$ npm install
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
$ npm run start
```


## Deployment

The app is currently deployed to [Heroku](http://heroku.com). You need to have a valid Heroku account and `Heroku CLI` installed on your machine. Also, you must have `node` and `npm` installed already.

Intall `Heroku CLI`. 

```
$ npm install -g heroku
```

Verifying your installation

```
$ heroku -v
```

Create heroku git repository

```
# make sure you don't have any uncommitted changes
$ git status

$ heroku login [your Heroku credentials]
$ heroku create [copy the second link]
$ git remote add heroku [paste the link]
$ git push heroku master
```

Open your app 

```
$ heroku open
```
